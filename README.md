# ALTAR | Master Art Reference

ALTAR is a web application that gives you a collection of artworks of up to three comic/manga artists of your selection. It can be used as a reference for art studies, or just as a gallery of iconic illustrations.

Tech Stack: React and Material UI for the frontend. NodeJS and Express for the underlying REST API, which is hosted with Netlify Functions (AWS Lambda). Also, LOTS of Javascript.
